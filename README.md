# CAI-data-analysis
There are four notebooks here, each being a crucial step in the process
1) First the CAI data was generated for each gene in the 3000+ E. Coli strains. This data was properly saved as shown in the code.
2) Then each gene needed to be classified on basis of subcellular location, for this selenium web driver was used to retrieve data from UniProt.
3) All this collected data needed to be cleaned. Genes with poor annotations were removed from the excel file containing list of genes. After this the data was ready to be analysed.
4) For data analysis, DBSCAN clustering was used.
5) This project is still ongoing, so newer data analysis methods will be added on later.
